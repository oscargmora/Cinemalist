This is Cinemalist. An easy to use website to keep track of all those movies you promised you would watch. You can input the Film Title, Notable Actors and Actresses, and Runtime of the movie. Then, you check whether or not you have watched it. Once it is added to your list, its watched status can be updated, so you can show all your friends you finally watched the latest A24 movie.
